Certification Validator Tool
============================

The Certification Validator Tool allows you to validate objects that have been
published in a public certificate repository.
 
You have downloaded the source release of the validator tool. If your goal is
to run the validator and not to examine the source code then you should consider
downloading the binary release from the certification website.

Prerequisites
-------------

For building the certification validator tool make sure you have the following
softwares and settings on your system.

- You are running a Unix-like operating system. Windows has not been tested.

- You have maven 2.2.1 installed (http://maven.apache.org/download.html) and
  the maven bin directory is on your path. If you have downloaded maven
  into your home directory then you can add it to your path by executing:
  
  $ export PATH=$HOME/apache-maven-2.2.1/bin/:$PATH

- You have SUN Java 6 JDK. If you have downloaded the Sun Java 6 JDK
  into your home directory then you can add it to your path by executing:
  
  $ export PATH=$HOME/jdk/bin/:$PATH

- Your JAVA_HOME variable is set. It should point to your Java 6 JDK
  directory. If you have downloaded the Sun Java 6 JDK into your home
  directory then you can set the JAVA_HOME variable by executing:
  
  $ export JAVA_HOME=$HOME/jdk/


Building
------------

Unpack the downloaded archive. A new directory named 
"certification-validator-X.Y-src" (where X.Y is the version) will be
automatically created containing the required components.

Install 2 components distributed in binary format into your maven repository
by executing the following commands:

  $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=commons-utils-1.30.jar -DgroupId=net.ripe.commons -DartifactId=commons-utils -Dversion=1.30 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true

  $ mvn install:install-file -Dfile=commons-internet-resources-1.30.jar -DgroupId=net.ripe.commons -DartifactId=commons-internet-resources -Dversion=1.30 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true


Build the validator by executing:

  $ mvn clean install


Once the build has successfully finished you can find the validator
in the certification-validator/target/certification-validator-X.Y-bin.zip
file (where X.Y is the version).
Please refer to the README.txt about how to use the binary distribution
that you have just created.
