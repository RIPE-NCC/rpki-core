Dear colleague,

This is an automated alert email about BGP announcements with your certified
address space for [[${humanizedCaName}]] in the Resource Certification (RPKI) service.
[# th:if="!${#lists.isEmpty(notFounds)}" ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There are BGP announcements that overlap with your certified address space that
have the status "Not Found". If the announcements are legitimate you should create
corresponding ROAs to make them Valid:

AS Number   Prefix
[# th:each="announcedroute : ${notFounds}" ][(${announcedroute.originAsn})]   [(${announcedroute.prefix})]
[/][/]
[# th:if="!${#lists.isEmpty(invalidAsns)}" ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

These are BGP announcements with your certified address space that have
the status "Invalid ASN". Since they are being originated from an unauthorised
AS, this may be an indicator that a hijack could be ongoing. If these are
legitimate announcements, you should authorise them by creating a ROA and
changing their status to "Valid".

AS Number   Prefix
[# th:each="announcedroute : ${invalidAsns}" ][(${announcedroute.originAsn})]   [( ${announcedroute.prefix})]
[/][/]
[# th:if="!${#lists.isEmpty(invalidLengths)}" ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

These are BGP announcements with your certified address space that have
the status "Invalid Length". The prefix length in the BGP announcement does
not match the prefix length in the corresponding ROA.

AS Number   Prefix
[# th:each="announcedroute : ${invalidLengths}"][(${announcedroute.originAsn})]   [(${announcedroute.prefix})]
[/][/]
[# th:if="!${#sets.isEmpty(ignoredAlerts)}" ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There are BGP announcements for your certified address space for which alerts
(such as this email) are muted. They are listed here as a reminder.

AS Number   Prefix
[# th:each="ignoredAlert : ${ignoredAlerts}" ][(${ignoredAlert.originAsn})]   [(${ignoredAlert.prefix})]
[/][/]
[# th:if="${#sets.isEmpty(ignoredAlerts)}" ]- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

There are no BGP announcements for your certified address space for which the
alerts have been muted.[/]
